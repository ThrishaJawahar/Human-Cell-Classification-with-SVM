# Human-Cell-Classification-with-SVM
In this project, I've used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to build and train a model to classify human cell samples as either benign or malignant. SVM is a powerful machine learning algorithm that works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space, where a hyperplane can be drawn to separate the categories, even if the data is not linearly separable.

Approach
1. Data Transformation: The model transforms the data into a higher-dimensional space where a hyperplane can distinguish between the benign and malignant cells.
2. Training: Using human cell records, the SVM algorithm is trained to find the optimal hyperplane that separates the two categories.
3. Prediction: After training, the model can predict whether new cell samples belong to the benign or malignant category based on their features.
